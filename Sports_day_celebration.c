Training for sports day has begun and the physical education teacher has decided to conduct some team games. The teacher wants to split the students in higher secondary into equal sized teams. In some cases, there may be some students who are left out from the teams and he wanted to use the left out students to assist him in conducting the team games.
For instance, if there are 50 students in a class and if the class has to be divided into 7 equal sized teams, 7 students will be there in each team and 1 student will be left out. That 1 student will assist the PET. With this idea in mind, the PET wants your help to automate this team splitting task. Can you please help him out?


#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a,b,c;
    scanf("%d%d",&a,&b);
    b=a/b;
    c=a%b;
    printf("%d\n",b);
    printf("%d\n",c);
}
